<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr>
<p>
  Hello! I'm Dhruv Veragiwala, currently a second-year student pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering at SRM University in Chennai.<br>
  When I'm not immersed in the world of coding and technology, you'll likely find me strumming away on my guitar, creating melodies that resonate with my soul.<br>
  I'm also a fan of silent parties, where the music takes center stage through headphones, creating a unique and immersive experience.<br>
  Join me on this journey of combining the best of both the tech and music worlds!
